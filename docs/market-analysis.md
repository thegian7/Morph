# Market Analysis: Ambient Screen Border Timer
**Date:** February 19, 2026
**Status:** Initial Research

---

## 1. Competitive Landscape

### 1.1 Direct Competitors

#### Timeqube / Timeqube Mind (Physical Device)
- **What it is:** A physical LED cube that changes color (green > orange > red) over a set time period, designed to sit in peripheral vision. The "Mind" variant is tailored for therapy/coaching sessions.
- **Pricing:** Pre-order at ~$89.90 USD (standard $109.90). Bulk discounts for 3+ units.
- **Strengths:**
  - First mover in "ambient color timer" concept
  - Strong positioning in the therapist/coaching market (designed with 60+ therapists)
  - Physical presence — no software to install, no OS compatibility issues
  - Session presets: 15, 30, 45, 50 (default), 60, 90 minutes
  - Visible from all angles in a room
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Expensive ($90-110 per unit) — barrier to casual adoption
  - No calendar integration — manual timer only
  - Single-purpose hardware — yet another device on your desk
  - No software/subscription revenue model (one-time purchase)
  - Cannot travel with your laptop — tied to a physical location
  - Limited to preset durations
  - No cross-platform equivalent for remote/hybrid workers
- **Market fit:** Primarily therapists and coaches. Some ADHD self-management users. Small company, niche market.

**This is the product LightTime most directly replaces.** The value proposition is: "Timeqube's ambient color concept, but built into your screen, integrated with your calendar, and available for $7/mo instead of $110 hardware."

#### Time Timer (Physical + App)
- **What it is:** The original "visual timer" — a clock-like device with a colored disk that shrinks as time passes. Also available as mobile apps.
- **Pricing:** Physical devices $10-40. App is free/low cost.
- **Strengths:**
  - Iconic brand, gold standard in ADHD/education communities
  - Very simple mental model (shrinking colored disk)
  - Endorsed by therapists, teachers, ADHD coaches
  - Multiple form factors (desktop, pocket, watch, app)
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Requires active visual attention — you have to look at it
  - Not ambient/peripheral — it is a clock you check
  - No calendar integration
  - Physical devices are standalone; apps are basic countdown timers
  - No desktop overlay or always-on-screen presence
- **Differentiation from LightTime:** Time Timer requires conscious checking. LightTime is designed to be absorbed subconsciously through peripheral vision. Fundamentally different interaction model.

### 1.2 Adjacent Software Competitors

#### Tiimo (iOS/Android/Web)
- **What it is:** Visual planner and timer for neurodivergent users. Uses icons, colors, and timelines to represent the day.
- **Pricing:** Free tier; Pro at ~$10-12/mo or $42-54/year depending on platform
- **Notable:** Won Apple's iPhone App of the Year 2025 — significant validation of the neurodivergent productivity market
- **Relevance:** Shares the "visual, ADHD-friendly" positioning, but is a full planner/task manager, not an ambient overlay. Users could use both products.

#### Llama Life
- **What it is:** Single-tasking timer and task list for ADHD users. Timeboxes tasks with countdown timers.
- **Pricing:** $6/mo or $39/year
- **Relevance:** Targets same ADHD audience but requires active engagement (reading task names, watching countdowns). Not ambient.

#### Centered / Sukha
- **What it is:** Flow state productivity app with focus music, distraction nudges, Do Not Disturb syncing, and task management.
- **Pricing:** Free tier; Premium at ~$6.67-10/mo
- **Relevance:** Similar "reduce cognitive overhead" philosophy, but focuses on audio/music rather than visual ambient cues. Possible integration partner.

#### Brain.fm
- **What it is:** AI-generated focus music scientifically designed to increase concentration.
- **Pricing:** $9.99/mo or $69.99/year (~$5.83/mo)
- **Relevance:** Targets the same "ambient aid for focus" concept but through audio, not visual. Complementary, not competitive.

#### Focusmate
- **What it is:** Virtual co-working with accountability partners.
- **Pricing:** Free (3 sessions/week); Plus at $6.99-9.99/mo
- **Relevance:** Social accountability approach. Different modality entirely.

### 1.3 Calendar-Centric Productivity Tools

#### Fantastical
- **Pricing:** $4.75-6.99/mo (annual billing)
- **Relevance:** Premium calendar app. Potential integration partner rather than competitor. LightTime reads calendar data but does not replace the calendar UI.

#### Sunsama
- **Pricing:** $16-20/mo
- **Relevance:** Calendar-based daily planner. Much more expensive, much broader scope. Shows willingness-to-pay exists for calendar-integrated productivity tools.

#### Morgen
- **Relevance:** Task + calendar consolidation. Complementary positioning.

### 1.4 Presentation/Meeting Overlay Timers

#### CueTimer
- **What it is:** Floating overlay timer for presenters. Can add blinking border and screen-reddening at timer end.
- **Relevance:** Closest existing product to the "screen overlay timer" concept, but designed for live events/presentations, not all-day ambient use. No calendar integration.

#### PT Timer (Presentation Timer)
- **What it is:** Semi-transparent overlay timer for PowerPoint presentations.
- **Relevance:** Proves the overlay-timer concept exists, but narrowly scoped to presentations.

### 1.5 Gap in the Market

**No existing product combines all three of:**
1. Ambient, peripheral visual cues (color-only, no numbers/text)
2. Calendar integration (automatic, no manual timer needed)
3. Desktop overlay (always visible, never covers content)

Timeqube has #1 but not #2 or #3. Time Timer has none. Tiimo has #2 but not #1 or #3. CueTimer has #3 but not #1 or #2. **This is a genuine white space.**

## 2. Market Validation

### 2.1 Market Size

The global ADHD apps market is projected at **$2.78 billion in 2026**, growing at a **15.65% CAGR** to reach $10.31 billion by 2035. The adult segment alone generated ~$1.16 billion in 2025 (41% of total market). North America accounts for ~$1.06 billion (38% share).

The broader "neurodiversity-aware workplace tools" market is also rapidly growing, driven by increased awareness and corporate DEI initiatives.

### 2.2 Demand Signals

**Tiimo winning Apple's 2025 iPhone App of the Year** is the strongest single validation signal. It proves:
- Apple recognizes neurodivergent productivity tools as a significant category
- Mainstream consumers are receptive to ADHD-targeted UX design
- The market is large enough to attract Apple's attention

**Community signals:**
- The ADHD subreddits (r/ADHD: 2M+ members, r/AuDHD: growing rapidly) consistently discuss time blindness as a top daily challenge
- "Visual timers" and "ambient time awareness" are frequently requested
- Users describe wanting time awareness that does not require active checking — exactly LightTime's value prop
- The phrase "time blindness" has entered mainstream vocabulary, with coverage in major outlets

**Professional signals:**
- Therapists already pay $90-110 for Timeqube, proving willingness to pay for ambient timing
- Therapy communities actively discuss alternatives to expensive physical timers
- Remote/hybrid work has made desktop-based tools more relevant than physical devices

### 2.3 Unmet Needs

Based on community research, people with ADHD/time blindness consistently express wanting:

1. **Awareness without interruption** — Notifications and alarms cause startle and anxiety. They want something gentler.
2. **Automatic operation** — They forget to start timers. Calendar integration removes this friction.
3. **Peripheral visibility** — Checking a separate device or app is a context switch they want to avoid.
4. **Affordable** — $100+ hardware is a barrier. Many are already spending on multiple ADHD tools.
5. **Transition support** — The hardest moment is switching between tasks/meetings. Current tools don't handle this well.

LightTime addresses all five.

## 3. Pricing Analysis

### 3.1 Comparable Product Pricing

| Product | Price (Monthly) | Price (Annual Equiv.) | Type |
|---------|----------------|-----------------------|------|
| Brain.fm | $9.99/mo | $5.83/mo | Focus music |
| Focusmate Plus | $9.99/mo | $6.99/mo | Virtual co-working |
| Centered/Sukha Premium | $10/mo | $6.67/mo | Flow state app |
| Llama Life | $6/mo | $3.25/mo | ADHD task timer |
| Fantastical | $6.99/mo | $4.75/mo | Calendar app |
| Tiimo Pro | $10-12/mo | $3.50-4.50/mo | ADHD visual planner |
| Sunsama | $20/mo | $16/mo | Calendar planner |
| Focus@Will | $7.49/mo | $4.37/mo | Focus music |
| **LightTime (proposed)** | **$7/mo** | **~$4.67/mo** | **Ambient timer** |

### 3.2 Pricing Assessment

**$7/mo is well-positioned:**

- Falls in the middle of the $6-10/mo range where most ADHD/focus productivity tools sit
- Below the "think twice" psychological threshold (~$10/mo)
- Annual at $56/year (~$4.67/mo) is competitive with Tiimo and Fantastical annual plans
- Significantly cheaper than the Timeqube hardware ($90-110) — pays for itself in under 2 months of use vs. buying the device
- The tool is "always-on" and calendar-integrated, justifying ongoing subscription (unlike a timer you use occasionally)

**Risk factors on pricing:**
- Free alternatives exist for basic countdown timers (though none offer the ambient + calendar combo)
- The free tier must be genuinely useful to drive trial — manual timer mode is good for this
- ADHD users often have difficulty managing subscriptions (ironic given the target market). Annual pricing should be pushed hard.
- Consider a **lifetime deal** ($150-200) for early adopters, especially to capture the Timeqube-replacement market

### 3.3 Revenue Projections Context

The PRD targets $10K MRR at 12 months. At $7/mo this requires ~1,430 paid subscribers, or at $56/year ~2,143 annual subscribers. Given 15,000 download target at 12% conversion, that's 1,800 paid users — achievable if the conversion rate holds. The conversion rate assumption of 12% is aggressive but defensible because the free tier (manual timer only) is deliberately limited, and calendar integration is the killer feature.

## 4. Risk Assessment

### 4.1 Technical Risks

#### macOS App Store Sandbox Restrictions (HIGH)
- Always-on-top overlays above fullscreen apps may conflict with macOS App Sandbox requirements
- Sandboxed apps have limited access to window layering APIs
- The WindowServer does not provide a first-party overlay API; third-party utilities rely on Accessibility and Screen Recording permissions
- Modern macOS security (SIP, notarization, hardened runtimes) restricts overlay injection techniques
- **Mitigation:** The PRD already lists this as an open question. Direct download distribution should be the primary channel, with App Store as a post-MVP stretch goal. Tauri apps can request necessary entitlements outside the App Store.

#### Tauri 2 Overlay/Click-Through Limitations (MEDIUM-HIGH)
- Tauri 2 does not have native click-through support for transparent windows built into the core
- There is an open GitHub issue (#13070) tracking this feature
- A third-party plugin (tauri-plugin-polygon) exists to define mouse response areas and achieve click-through behavior
- Transparent window rendering has known issues on some platforms (GitHub issue #8308)
- **Mitigation:** Technical spike required before committing to Tauri. The polygon plugin may suffice for MVP, but this is the highest-priority technical risk to de-risk.

#### macOS Fullscreen Space Isolation (MEDIUM)
- macOS fullscreen apps run in separate Spaces, and overlay windows from other apps may not follow into fullscreen Spaces
- Requires elevated window level (NSWindowLevel.screenSaver or above), which may trigger macOS security prompts
- **Mitigation:** Test thoroughly with common fullscreen workflows (Zoom calls, presentation mode, fullscreen browsers). Graceful degradation if fullscreen overlay is not possible on certain OS versions.

### 4.2 Market Risks

#### Market Too Niche (MEDIUM)
- The "ambient visual timer + calendar" concept is novel, which means it needs to be explained — harder to market than an obvious category
- ADHD tools are growing but still niche compared to general productivity
- **Mitigation:** The three-audience strategy (knowledge workers, ADHD community, therapists) diversifies risk. Knowledge workers provide scale; ADHD community provides word-of-mouth; therapists provide conversion confidence.

#### Timeqube or Large Player Pivots to Software (LOW-MEDIUM)
- Timeqube could build a software version of their product
- A larger player (Fantastical, Apple, Microsoft) could add ambient timer features
- **Mitigation:** Timeqube is a small hardware company — software pivot is non-trivial. Apple/Microsoft adding this as an OS feature is possible but unlikely in the near term. First-mover advantage and community loyalty in the ADHD space matter.

#### Subscription Fatigue (MEDIUM)
- Users increasingly resist adding another $7/mo subscription
- ADHD users especially struggle with subscription management
- **Mitigation:** Strong free tier for acquisition. Annual pricing for retention. Consider lifetime deal for early adopters. The tool's value is immediately visible (literally), which helps justify ongoing cost.

### 4.3 Legal/IP Risks

#### Patent Risk (LOW)
- No patents were found specifically covering "ambient color-changing screen borders for time awareness"
- Existing patents cover general window management (always-on-top, compositing) but these are foundational OS features, not application-level concepts
- The Timeqube product is hardware — different patent domain
- **Mitigation:** Conduct a formal freedom-to-operate search before launch, but risk appears low.

#### Trademark Risk (See Section 5)
- Several proposed names have conflicts. See naming analysis below.

### 4.4 Adoption Risks

#### Accessibility Permissions Friction (MEDIUM)
- On macOS, the app will likely need Accessibility and possibly Screen Recording permissions
- These prompts are scary for non-technical users ("This app wants to control your computer")
- **Mitigation:** Clear onboarding flow explaining why permissions are needed. In-app guidance with screenshots. Community content addressing this.

#### Colorblind Accessibility (LOW if addressed)
- The default green-to-red spectrum is invisible to ~8% of males with red-green color blindness
- **Mitigation:** The PRD already flags this. Provide alternative color themes (blue-to-orange, etc.) at launch or very early post-MVP.

## 5. Name Analysis

### 5.1 Proposed Names — Conflict Assessment

| Name | Conflicts Found | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------------|----------|-------|
| **Halo** | Multiple conflicts | HIGH | "Halo Time" app exists (time tracking). "Halo" self-improvement app exists. HaloPSA/HaloITSM are established B2B brands. Microsoft's Halo franchise dominates search results. Very crowded name. |
| **Aura** | Major conflict | CRITICAL | Aura Health is a major wellness app (8M+ users, Apple "Best of" winner). Uses "Aura" in the exact wellness/productivity/mindfulness space. Would cause direct confusion and likely trademark issues. **Strongly avoid.** |
| **Periphery** | No direct conflicts | LOW | No productivity/timer apps found with this name. "Periphery" is a metal band (strong SEO competition) but no software conflicts in the relevant space. Good conceptual fit — evokes peripheral vision, the core interaction model. |
| **Fringe** | No direct conflicts | LOW | No productivity apps found with this name. "Fringe" has TV show SEO competition but is distinct in the software context. Conceptual fit is decent — suggests edges, borders. |
| **Glow** | Multiple conflicts | MEDIUM-HIGH | GlowStatus exists (status tracking app). Glow by Luma Labs (3D content). Glow system analysis tool. "Glow" is heavily used across tech. Would require strong modifier (e.g., "Glow Timer"). |
| **Liminal** | One conflict | MEDIUM | Liminal.ai exists as an AI security platform. However, different enough domain that confusion is unlikely. "Liminal" is a strong conceptual fit (liminal = threshold/between-states), very on-brand for time transitions. |

### 5.2 Additional Name Candidates

Based on the product's core identity (peripheral, ambient, color-based, threshold-aware), here are alternative names to explore:

| Name | Rationale | Potential Conflicts |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Drift** | Evokes the gentle passage of time; "time drifts by" | "Drift" is a customer messaging platform (drift.com). Would need checking. |
| **Tinge** | A slight trace of color; exactly what the border is | Uncommon word; unlikely conflicts. May be too subtle. |
| **Bloom** | Color blooming at edges; organic, gentle | Common app name. Needs checking. |
| **Soften** | The opposite of jarring alarms; describes the experience | Unusual as an app name; distinctive. |
| **Threshold** | Where time transitions happen; the border is a literal threshold | Long name but highly descriptive. No obvious conflicts. |
| **Ember** | Warm glow, color transition (green-amber-red), always present | "Ember.js" framework has strong SEO. "Ember" climate app exists. |
| **Penumbra** | The partial shadow between full light and darkness; transitional | Distinctive, atmospheric. Some indie game conflicts. |
| **Margin** | The border of a page; the space between events | Simple, distinctive in app context. "Margin" finance app may conflict. |
| **LightTime** | (Current project name) Light + Time. Clean, memorable. | "LightTime" GTD/to-do app exists on iOS/Android (Xiamen iScreen). Moderate conflict. |

### 5.3 Naming Recommendations

**Strongest candidates (low conflict, strong concept fit):**

1. **Periphery** — Directly describes the product's interaction model (peripheral vision). No conflicts found. Distinctive, memorable, and descriptive without being generic.
2. **Liminal** — "Between states" perfectly describes the time-transition concept. Minor conflict with Liminal.ai (different domain). Intellectually appealing to the target audience.
3. **Fringe** — Evokes the screen edge/border. No conflicts. Short, punchy. Slightly edgier brand voice.

**Avoid:** Aura (critical conflict), Halo (crowded), Glow (crowded)

## 6. Key Takeaways

### The Opportunity is Real
- The ADHD productivity market is large ($2.78B in 2026) and growing fast (15.65% CAGR)
- Tiimo's App Store Award validates mainstream appetite for neurodivergent-first design
- No existing product combines ambient visual cues + calendar integration + desktop overlay
- Timeqube proves the concept works but is limited by hardware form factor and price

### The Timing is Good
- Remote/hybrid work makes desktop-based solutions more relevant
- ADHD awareness is at an all-time high; "time blindness" is mainstream vocabulary
- The Timeqube is increasingly outdated as people spend more time at screens than at desks with physical devices

### Critical Path Items
1. **Technical spike on Tauri overlay + click-through** — this is the make-or-break technical question
2. **Validate $7/mo with a landing page** before building — the PRD correctly identifies this
3. **Name decision** — "Periphery" or "Liminal" are the strongest options; formal trademark search needed
4. **Colorblind-accessible themes** should be in MVP, not post-MVP, given 8% of male users affected

### Competitive Moat
The product's moat is the combination of:
- Ambient (not active) — unique interaction paradigm
- Calendar-connected (not manual) — unique in the ambient timer space
- Desktop overlay (not separate device/app) — always visible without checking
- ADHD-native design philosophy — not retrofitted accessibility

If executed well, this has first-mover advantage in a white space with a large and growing target market.
